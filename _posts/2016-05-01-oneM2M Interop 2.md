The purpose of this event is to verify the primitive’s interoperability as defined in the oneM2M standards and to check end-to-end functionality on oneM2M interfaces Mca and Mcc.The implementations will have to support CoAP, HTTP and MQTT protocol binding.Interoperability test scenarios from TS-0013 (interoperability testing) are proposed to participants. The testing ae based on the:
* oneM2M Release 1 standards TS-0001 (Functional Architecture)
* TS-0004 (Service Layer Core Protocol)
* TS-0008 (CoAP Protocol Binding)
* TS-0009 (HTTP Protocol Binding)
* TS-0010 (MQTT Protocol Binding)

The Interop Event may also include Conformance Testing Tool Demo in order to introduce and help to understand the oneM2M conformance testing. This Interoperability event will offer test sessions where companies can assess the level of interoperability of their implementations and verify the correct interpretation of the oneM2M standards.Please note that the interoperability results are not to be public as the event is covered by a Non-Disclosure Agreement.This activity is supported by the Korean Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning and the European Commission.
